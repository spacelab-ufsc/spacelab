## Overview

SpaceLab brings together several research groups from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil. The different groups conduct research and development activities in space systems in general, aiming to make space more accessible not only to the scientific community but also to the industry. Featured missions include FloripaSat-1, GOLDS-UFSC, and GOMX-5.

This organization combines repositories for different projects, files and documents. The following sections briefly describes the main repositories and their relation to the SpaceLab's missions.

## Missions

SpaceLab has complete CubeSat space missions developed in-house under open-source licenses: [FloripaSat-1](https://floripasat.ufsc.br/), an 1U CubeSat, and [GOLDS-UFSC](http://golds.ufsc.br/), a 2U CubeSat.

#### FloripaSat-1
