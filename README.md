## Overview

SpaceLab brings together several research groups from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil. The different groups conduct research and development activities in space systems in general, aiming to make space more accessible not only to the scientific community but also to the industry. Featured missions include FloripaSat-1, FloripaSat-2, and GOMX-5.

This organization combines repositories for different projects, files and documents. The following sections briefly describes the main repositories and their relation to the SpaceLab's major space campaigns.

## Missions

SpaceLab has complete CubeSat space missions developed in-house under open-source licenses: [FloripaSat-1](https://floripasat.ufsc.br/), an 1U CubeSat, and [FloripaSat-2](http://floripasat.ufsc.br/), a 2U CubeSat.

#### FloripaSat-1
This CubeSat mission was the first attempt to develop a complete satellite mission in-house (with some COTS subsystems). The service modules were designed and developed by the SpaceLab team, which started with prototype versions until the actual flight model. The original GitHub organization used in this mission was the [FloripaSat](https://github.com/floripasat), but it was descontinued in order to accomodate all SpaceLab projects in the same place. The mission repositories and related projects in this organization are:

- [OBDH](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/obdh) (On-Board Data Handling module)
- [EPS](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/eps) (Electrical Power System module)
- [TTC](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/ttc) (Telemetry, Tracking and Command module)
- [GRS](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/grs) (Ground Station Firmware)
- [Payload-X](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/payload-x-firmware) (Payload-X firmware)
- [Decoder](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/spacelab-decoder) (SpaceLab Packet Decoder)
- [DOC](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/floripasat-doc) (Some documentation files)

#### FloripaSat-2
This CubeSat mission is a second generation development, which uses the FloripaSat-1 core and flight heritage. The mission consists of a 2U CubeSat designed in-house (with some COTS subsystems). The following repositories includes all the avaliable sources:

- [DOC](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/floripasat2-doc) (Mission documentation)
- [OBDH 2.0](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/obdh2) (On-Board Data Handling module 2.0)
- [EPS 2.0](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/eps2) (Electrical Power System module 2.0)
- [TTC](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/ttc) (Telemetry, Tracking and Command module)
- [Battery Module](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/battery-module-4c)
- [GRS](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/grs) (Ground Station Firmware)
- [PC-104 Adapter](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/pc104-adapter)
- [Interface Modules](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/interface-board)
- [MEC](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/floripasat2-mechanical) (Mechanical assembly)
- [FlatSat](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/flatsat-platform)
- [Decoder](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/spacelab-decoder) (SpaceLab Packet Decoder)

## Projects

Besides missions, the SapceLab has standalone projects:

- [Daughter Boards for OBDH 2.0](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/daughterboards)
- [Altium components library](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/altium-library)
- [SpaceLab PCB Standard](https://github.com/spacelab-ufsc/pcb-standard)

## Competitions

In order to train the next generation of undergraduate students for future opportunities, the lab supports initiatives for taking part in contests and events in the aerospace sector. Efforts are focused on attracting new students and outreach SpaceLab to the community. Currently, there are two groups associated with SpaceLab: [FloripaSat](https://spacelab.ufsc.br/en/floripasat), a CubeSat competition group, and the [Apex Rocketry](https://spacelab.ufsc.br/en/apex-rocketry/), a rocket competition team.

> This list considers current members of this GitHub organization. For a more complete list, refer to [FloripaSat-1 team](https://floripasat.ufsc.br/team/) and [SpaceLab team](https://spacelab.ufsc.br/en/people/).

## Partners

Refer to the [SpaceLab partners page](https://spacelab.ufsc.br/en/people/). 

## Versioning

The repositories have different versions depending on the development efforts and duration. Then, it is important to refer to the documentation (in the mission repository, for example) which versions are compatible with all the modules and subsystems. The scheme followed try to minimize errors and misunderstandings by synchronizing macro versions within a mission using releases and presentend simple version and status badges. The main versioning system is the GitHub release feature itself, giving the status badges only a quick overview of the project for external viewers. For example, each module within the FloripaSat-2 mission follows a vX.Y.Z versioning scheme, in which Z determines minor self contained changes, Y sets relevant amount of changes or important checkpoints, and X major mission checkpoints. In this case, the flight version might be a v1.0.0 or higher. As aforesaid, the badges are only used for quick status verification and uses the following structure:

## Licenses

The SpaceLab follows a strong open-source approach in order to encourage and promote knowledge. Then, refer to the LICENSE file in the GitHub page for each repository. In general, the licenses used are GPLv3 for firmware/software, CERN OHL-S v2 for hardware, and CC-BY-SA-4.0 for documents. Please, double check licenses and third-part components used with other licenses, since restrictions might apply.
